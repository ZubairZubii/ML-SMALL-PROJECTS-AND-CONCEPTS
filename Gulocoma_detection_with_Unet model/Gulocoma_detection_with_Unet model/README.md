## 🚀 Installation

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**

### Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Load Your Images and Masks**: Ensure your image and mask directories are properly structured.
2. **Run the Training Script**: Execute the training script to train the U-Net model on your dataset.

```python
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load and preprocess your data
images, masks = load_data(image_dir, mask_dir)

# Define and compile the U-Net model
model = unet_model(input_shape=(512, 512, 3))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=dice_loss, metrics=[dice_coefficient])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(images, masks, epochs=2, batch_size=4, verbose=1)
```

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use the provided evaluation functions to assess your model's performance.

---

## 📈 Model Training

```python
# Compile and train the model
model.fit(images, masks, epochs=10, batch_size=4, validation_split=0.2)

# Plot training history
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.title('Training Loss')
plt.show()
```

### Example Training Output

```
Epoch 1/10
3/3 [==============================] - 24s 7s/step - loss: 0.1249 - dice_coefficient: 0.8773
Epoch 2/10
3/3 [==============================] - 20s 6s/step - loss: 0.0630 - dice_coefficient: 0.9399
```

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate your model with the following metrics to understand its performance better:

- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model is correct.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Measure of overlap between predicted and ground truth masks.

### Compute Metrics Example

```python
accuracy = compute_accuracy(binarized_ground_truth_masks, binarized_predicted_masks)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
